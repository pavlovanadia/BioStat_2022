The dataset is located in the *data* folder. The Jupyter Notebook with data analysis is located in the *code* folder.

If ypu would like to run the code yourself instead of html file reading please note that:

The project was created with **Python 3.9.12**.

External libraries are used, so for better performance it is recommended to upload the libraries versions from the *requirements.txt* file. If you wish to do that, please:

- `python3 -m venv environment`  create the virtual environment
- `source environment/bin/activate` activate the virtual environment

If you wish to run the script as Jupyter Notebook and use VSCode, you should install it as well:
- `pip3 install ipykernel`
- `python3 -m ipykernel install --user --name=projectname`
- reload VSCode and choose the correct Kernel (will contain the name of your project)

- `pip install -r requirements.txt` upload the requirements

If you wish to deactivate your virtual environment:
